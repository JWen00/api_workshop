# Web-Dev Workshop (Summer 2019) 

This workshop aims to teach students about API's and the basics of connecting backend with frontend using _flask_.

The entire workshop is expected to run for the day, with the only requirements being access to [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/python3).

The css and html files are provided to the students in _templates_.


### IP Stack

ApiKey for the IP address is retrieved from [ipStack](https://ipstack.com/)  


### GoogleMaps ApiKey

ApiKey for GoogleMaps has to be supplied. 

```
 imageLink = 'https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap?center=' + str(lat) + ',' + str(lon) + '&size=555x300&zoom=12&scale=4&key=' + mapKey
```


### Setup 

```
python3 server.py
```

### Disclaimer 

I wrote this before I officially learnt flask so.. mhmm :)

There is also an _api nodejs version_ which we scrapped because we thought the students were better off sticking to python since the week-long workshop was entirely python.
